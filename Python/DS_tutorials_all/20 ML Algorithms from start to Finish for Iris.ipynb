This dataset contains information about three different types of Iris flowers:\n\n* Iris Versicolor\n* Iris Virginica\n* Iris Setosa\n\nThe data set contains measurements of four variables :\n\n* sepal length \n* sepal width\n* petal length \n* petal width\n \nThe Iris data set has a number of interesting features:\n\n1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.\n\n2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.\n\n3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.\n\n**Why am I  using iris dataset:**\n\n1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n\n2- Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n\n3- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n\n4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.\n\n5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).\n\n6- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.[5]\n\n7- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n<a id=\"5\"></a> <br>\n### 3-2 Aim\nThe aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals\n<a id=\"6\"></a> <br>\n### 3-3 Variables\nThe variables are :\n**sepal_length**: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**sepal_width**: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_length**: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_width**: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.\n**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.\n**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as target.\n\n**<< Note >>**\n> You must answer the following question:\nHow does your company expact to use and benfit from your model."

It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers in three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\".\nThe data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n\nAs a result, **iris dataset is used as the input of all algorithms**.\n<a id=\"9\"></a> <br>\n### 4-2 Outputs\nthe outputs for our algorithms totally depend on the type of classification or clustering algorithms.\nthe outputs can be the number of clusters or predict for new input.\n\n**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.\n**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.\n**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as a target."

It’s a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.\n### 5-3-1 What browsers are supported?\nColaboratory works with most major browsers, and is most thoroughly tested with desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox.\n### 5-3-2 Is it free to use?\nYes. Colaboratory is a research project that is free to use.\n### 5-3-3 What is the difference between Jupyter and Colaboratory?\nJupyter is the open source project on which Colaboratory is based. Colaboratory allows you to use and share Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything on your own computer other than a browser.\n5-4 Python vs Matlab vs R  vs Octave\nWhy you sdould use python?\n\nAs **machine learning engineer** I would like to compare 4 machine learning programming languages(tools). Let's take this a bit deeper. Since most of us are concerned with ML and analysis being a big part of why we are using these programs. I want to list a few advantages and disadvantages of each for who want to start learning them as a data scientist.\n\n\n## 1-1-1 R\n\nR is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by **John Chambers** and colleagues. **R** can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.\n\n\n### 1-1-1-1 Advantages of R \n\n\n* End To End development to execution (some brokers packages allows execution, IB)\n* Rapid development speed (60% fewer lines vs python, ~500% less than C)\n* A large number of Open Source Packages\n* Mature quantitative trading packages( quantstrat, quantmod, performanceanalyitics, xts)\n* Largest Community\n* Can integrate into C++/C with rcpp\n\n### 1-1-1-2 Disadvantages of R \n\n* Slow vs Python especially in iterative loops and non vectorized functions\n* Worse plotting than Matlab and difficult to implement interactive charts\n* Limited capabilities in creating stand-alone applications\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n## 1-1-2 Python\n\nPython is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.\n\n### Advantages\n\n* End To End development to execution (some brokers packages allows execution, IB)\n* Open source packages( Pandas, Numpy, scipy) \n* Trading Packages(zipline, pybacktest, pyalgotrade)\n* best for general programming and application development\n* can be a \"glue\" language to connect R, C++, and others (python)\n* Fastest general speed especially in iterative loops\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n* immature packages especially trading packages\n* some packages are not compatible with others or contain overlap\n* smaller community than R in finance\n* More code required for same operations vs R or Matlab\n* Silent errors that can take a very long time to track down (even with visual debuggers / IDE)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n##  MATLAB\n\n**MATLAB (matrix laboratory)** is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment. A proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, a creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran, and Python.\n\nAlthough MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, allowing access to symbolic computing abilities. An additional package, Simulink, adds graphical multi-domain simulation and model-based design for dynamic and embedded systems.\n\n### Advantages\n\nFastest mathematical and computational platform especially vectorized operations/ linear matrix algebra \nCommercial level packages for all fields of mathematics and trading\nVery short scripts considering the high integration of all packages\nBest visualization of plots and interactive charts\nWell tested and supported due to it being a commercial product\nEasy to manage multithreaded support and garbage collection\nBest debugger\n\n###  Disadvantages\n\nCan not execute - must be translated into another language\nExpensive ~1000 per license and 50+ per additional individual package\nCan not integrate well with other languages\nHard to detect biases in trading systems (it was built for math and engineering simulations) so extensive testing may be required. EG. look ahead bias\nWorst performance for iterative loops\nCan not develop stand-alone applications at all.\n\n## Octave\n\nOctave is sort of the GNU answer to the commercial language MATLAB. That is, it is a scripting matrix language, and has a syntax that is about 95% compatible with MATLAB. It's a language designed by engineers, and thus is heavily loaded with routines commonly used by engineers. It has many of the same time series analysis routines, statistics routines, file commands, and plotting commands of the MATLAB language.\n\n### Advantages\n\nFirst of all, there is no robust Octave compiler available and this is not really necessary either since the software can be installed free of charge.\nLooking at the language element the two packages are identical except for some particularities like nested functions. Octave is under constant active development and every deviation from the Matlab syntax is treated as a bug or at least an issue to be resolved.\nThere are also plenty of toolboxes available for octave and as long as a program does not require graphical output there is a good chance that it runs under Octave just like under Matlab without considerable modification.\nGraphics capabilities are clearly an advantage of Matlab. The latest versions include a GUI designer on top of excellent visualization features.\nOctave uses either GNU Plot or JHandles as graphics packages, where the latter is somehow closer to what Matlab provides. However, there are no Octave equivalents to a GUI designer and the visualization mechanisms are somehow limited and not Matlab compatible.\nThe same holds for an integrated development environment. There is a project called QTOctave but it is still at an early stage.\nLooking at the collaborate efforts taking place around the Octave community it is likely that this software will soon provide better and possibly even compatible graphics and GUI capabilities and it is well worth a look before buying Matlab.\n\n###  Disadvantages\n\nit just a free open source of MATLAB and don't bring us anything new\n\n\n![compare1][1]\n![compare2][2]\n\n\n\nto sum up, there are several tools for data scientist and machine learning engineer in the below chart you can see which one is more popular than others.\n![compare1][3]\n**[reference][4]**\n\n\n  [1]: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHC8vSsbqji1A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1543449600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=lUVejbr2Lwdz9hZuYmVY3upQB2B4ZIjJsP6eiwvrW0A\n  [2]: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEH61x6adp36A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1543449600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=EJdx7dx7UMFnOpc5QndIulg9GI2Fd1NyAouEM6s945Q\n  [3]: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQGPCHd41RDuzg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1543449600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=aksgcN2r_TRkBKgaxYbLh-rZHsMa8xqXiBm-oravz-k\n  [4]: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/r-vs-python-matlab-octave-mohamadjavad-mj-bahmani/\n  \n  [Download paper](https://github.com/mjbahmani/Machine-Learning-Workflow-with-Python/blob/master/Ebooks/R%20vs%20Python%20vs%20MATLAB%20%20vs%20Octave.pdf)"

We continuously need to predict correct values, impute missing ones, and find links between various data artefacts such as schemas and records. We need to stop treating data cleaning as a piecemeal exercise (resolving different types of errors in isolation), and instead leverage all signals and resources (such as constraints, available statistics, and dictionaries) to accurately predict corrective actions.\n\nThe primary goal of data cleaning is to detect and remove errors and **anomalies** to increase the value of data in analytics and decision making. While it has been the focus of many researchers for several years, individual problems have been addressed separately. These include missing value imputation, outliers detection, transformations, integrity constraints violations detection and repair, consistent query answering, deduplication, and many other related problems such as profiling and constraints mining.[8]"

It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.\n**What is the difference between accuracy and precision?**\n\"Accuracy\" and \"precision\" are general terms throughout science.

The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms."

Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a **predictive analysis**.\n\nIn statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a widely used statistical model that, in its basic form, uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable; many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model; it is a form of binomial regression. Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick; these are represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\""

When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the samples, then this algorithm is known as Pasting . If samples are drawn with replacement, then the method is known as Bagging . When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the features, then the method is known as Random Subspaces . Finally, when base estimators are built on subsets of both samples and features, then the method is known as Random Patches .[http://scikit-learn.org]"
