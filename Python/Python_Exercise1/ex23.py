"""Define a simple "spelling correction" function correct() that 
takes a string and sees to it that 1) two or more occurrences of 
the space character is compressed into one, and 2) inserts an extra 
space after a period if the period is directly followed by a letter. 
E.g. correct("This   is  very funny  and    cool.Indeed!") should 
return "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!" Tip: Use regular 
expressions!"""
