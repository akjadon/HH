"""Write a program able to play the "Guess the number"-game, where the 
number to be guessed is randomly chosen between 1 and 20. 
(Source: http://inventwithpython.com) This is how it should work when run 
in a terminal:

>>> import guess_number
Hello! What is your name?
Torbjörn
Well, Torbjörn, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
Take a guess.
10
Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
15
Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
18
Good job, Torbjörn! You guessed my number in 3 guesses!"""

from random import randrange

def gtn():
	print("Hello! What is your name?")
	gamer_name = input()

	print('Well, %s, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.' % gamer_name)
	
	my_number = randrange(1,21) # Choose a number between 1 and 20
	tries = 0 # Count how many times the user guessed our number

	while True:
		print('Take a guess.')

		gamer_guess = int(input()) # We make sure it's a number
		tries += 1

		if gamer_guess == my_number:
			print('Good job, %s! You guessed my number in %d guesses!' % (gamer_name, tries))
			break
		elif gamer_guess < my_number:
			print('Your guess is too low.')
		else:
			print('Your guess is too high.')
