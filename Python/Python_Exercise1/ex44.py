"""Your task in this exercise is as follows:

Generate a string with N opening brackets ("[") and N closing brackets ("]"), 
in some arbitrary order. Determine whether the generated string is balanced; 
that is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing brackets 
(in that order), none of which mis-nest.
Examples:

   []        OK   ][        NOT OK
   [][]      OK   ][][      NOT OK
   [[][]]    OK   []][[]    NOT OK
"""

	# Add brackets in an arbitrary order
	while i < n*2:
		result += brackets[randrange(len(brackets))]

	# Save our string of brackets
	bracket_string = result

	# Remove all found pairs of brackets using regex
	while len(re.findall(r'\[\]', result)) > 0:
		result = re.sub(r'\[\]', '', result)
