"""Define a function generate_n_chars() that takes an 
integer n and a character c and returns a string, n 
characters long, consisting only of c:s. For example, 
generate_n_chars(5,"x") should return the string "xxxxx". 
(Python is unusual in that you can actually write an expression 5 * "x" 
that will evaluate to "xxxxx". For the sake of the exercise you should 
ignore that the problem can be solved in this manner.)"""
