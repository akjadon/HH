"""99 Bottles of Beer" is a traditional song in the United States and 
Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive 
format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. 
The song's simple lyrics are as follows:

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. 
The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero.

Your task here is write a Python program capable of generating 
all the verses of the song."""

i = 99
while i > 0:
  print("""%(b)d %(bo)s of beer on the wall, %(b)d %(bo)s of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, %(lb)d %(lbo)s of beer on the wall.""" % \
  {'b': i, 'lb': i-1, 'bo': 'bottle' if i == 1 else 'bottles', 'lbo': 'bottle' \
  if i == 2 else 'bottles' })
