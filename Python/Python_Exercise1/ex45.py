"""A certain childrens game involves starting with a word in a particular 
category. Each participant in turn says a word, but that word must begin 
with the final letter of the previous word. Once a word has been given, it 
cannot be repeated. If an opponent cannot give a word in the category, they 
fall out of the game. For example, with "animals" as the category,

Child 1: dog 
Child 2: goldfish
Child 1: hippopotamus
Child 2: snake
...
Your task in this exercise is as follows: Take the following selection of 70 
English Pokemon names (extracted from Wikipedia's list of Pokemon) and 
generate the/a sequence with the highest possible number of Pokemon names 
where the subsequent name starts with the final letter of the preceding name. 
No Pokemon name is to be repeated.
