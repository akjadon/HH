"""An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters 
of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original 
letters exactly once; e.g., orchestra = carthorse. Using the word list at 
http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, write a program that 
finds the sets of words that share the same characters that contain the most 
words in them."""
